# Design Manifesto

As a student this term, I gained much more experience in HCI than I have in any other term through my expereince in this class as well as my experience in Software Engineering designing an application that allows for pathfinding through Brigham & Women's Hospital.
The design process I developed in both classes ended up having an impact on the other, and I believe they are the perfect pairing to develop a student's HCI abiilties. The knowledge gained from HCI and the assigned articles gave me inspiration for the Hospital Pathfinding project, while the intense user testing and development life cycle of Software Engineering allowed me to go more in depth into the assignments in HCI.

Below are 5 key points that came to define my design process this term. Click here to return to the Portfolio.

## Don’t rush.
Starting at the beginning of the term, I ignored the design process that was recomended. I simply just rushed ahead and did the projects without any brainstorming, user testing, or prepararion. And although I didn't know it, it showed.
I actually didn't come to realise it in HCI, but in Software Engineering when during our presentation I realised how cluttered and difficult to use our UI was. What it took was some distance to understand that taking your time and actually following a fleshed out design will force you to take your time and truly think about what you're doing before you implement it.
A key example in HCI was in the Design for Others project in which we decided that the given website was already good enough so we just resized it into a mobile format instead of brainstorming a new UI that would actually be better and designed from the ground up for mobile. The lesson that I learned there I will carry over for the rest of my career as a Computer Scientist and already have, as seviddneced by my new stragtegy with the later HCI projects.

## Simpler is better.
Most of my HCI projects were relatively simple, but it's their simplicity that taught me its merits. For instance, in Software Engineering, our UI started off rather clunky and complicated. 

## Empathize.
I've always been someone who immediatly empathizes with people whenever they talk about their struggles, I easily put myself in their shoes and geniunly try to understand them.
I cam to understand this term that empathy just as important a trait in HCI as in society. In my later projects, I began working on topics that appealed to my sense of empathy (in Design for Tension we created a chatbot for prisoners who will have a tough time once realeased into society and in Design for Another World we created a simulation meant to calm and relax patients) In these projects, it became really important to put myself in the shoes of the users, to try and really understand how they were feeling and what they needed from the aaplicaton.

I’m someone who is always sympathetic. When I hear about someone’s struggles I easily put myself in their shoes and feel truly sorry for their pain.
Once I brought this aspect of me to design during this class, I began creating things that required Empathy to truly understand (Prisoner, Terminally Ill Patients)

## Research on people, not Google.
Towards the beginning, it was always easy to just follow guidelines set on Google rather than real life users. But I’ve since learned that every project you design is too specific to have an answer online, it’s going to need a person to test it. Because if your design is common enough to be on Google, then it’s not worth doing.

## Create a chain-of-events.
One technique I found useful was to create a chain of events of what I thought a user would interact with the project. Comparing this chain of events with what the user actually did was always illuminating as it showed me how differently my design was being interpreted than how I meant it to be interpreted
