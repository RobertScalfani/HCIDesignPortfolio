# Design Manifesto

As a student this term, I gained much more experience in HCI than I have in any other term through my expereince in this class as well as my experience in Software Engineering designing an application that allows for pathfinding through Brigham & Women's Hospital.
The design process I developed in both classes ended up having an impact on the other, and I believe they are the perfect pairing to develop a student's HCI abiilties. The knowledge gained from HCI and the assigned articles gave me inspiration for the Hospital Pathfinding project, while the intense user testing and development life cycle of Software Engineering allowed me to go more in depth into the assignments in HCI.

Below are 5 key points that came to define my design process this term. Click here to return to the Portfolio.

# Don’t rush.
Used to just go ahead and create something, without a strategy beforehand
Now I follow a set pattern that slows me down and allows me to think before implementing

# Simpler is better.
Both from my own projects, and through testing others’ projects, it became far more clear to me that simpler truly is better in a way that an article can’t describe.

# Empathize.
I’m someone who is always sympathetic. When I hear about someone’s struggles I easily put myself in their shoes and feel truly sorry for their pain.
Once I brought this aspect of me to design during this class, I began creating things that required Empathy to truly understand (Prisoner, Terminally Ill Patients)

# Research on people, not Google.
Towards the beginning, it was always easy to just follow guidelines set on Google rather than real life users. But I’ve since learned that every project you design is too specific to have an answer online, it’s going to need a person to test it. Because if your design is common enough to be on Google, then it’s not worth doing.

# Create a chain-of-events.
One technique I found useful was to create a chain of events of what I thought a user would interact with the project. Comparing this chain of events with what the user actually did was always illuminating as it showed me how differently my design was being interpreted than how I meant it to be interpreted
